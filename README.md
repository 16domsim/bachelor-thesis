# Bachelor thesis: Depth-Optimal Synthesis of Graph State Preparation Circuits


This repository contains the code developed as part of my research during my Bachelor thesis, 
which focuses on achieving depth-optimal synthesis of graph state preparation circuits.


In this thesis, two different approaches to perform the depth-optimal synthesis of graph state preparation circuits are presented:

1. **Stabilizer Tableau Encoding in SAT**: This approach encodes a representation of the circuit into a SAT (Boolean satisfiability) problem.
2. **Graph-Based Edge Coloring in SAT**: This approach utilizes the underlying mathematical graph of the circuit to perform edge coloring encoded in SAT to compute the optimal depth.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my advisor and professor for their support and guidance throughout this research.
